# Age Of The Wild : The Beginning

_**There was a time on earth before humans, when it was Dark and Pitch-Black...**_

_The Sky..._

_The Ground..._

_The Sea..._

_Everthing was Pitch-Black and still..._

Nothing stirred.No colours was seen.

Suddenly....

A blue and red  ball arouse from nowhere... 

It was so bright that the whole place was lit for a moment. They disappeared as soon as they appeared. 
The world was again pitch black.

Many years went by...

Man finally stepped on the blue planet. The surroundings had changed now. It was
broad daylight and life was seen almost everywhere. Man had now began to
conquer the world with his intelligence. He made many ways to survive.
The Man went on to become more and more advanced by the time. 

In the year 1970, when the linux shell was built...(Don't think this story is
_about computers!_ No, no, no! I'am keeping it as a point of reference.)

A family, like any other family, had built a house _exactly near the spot the
balls appeared._

One day _Michael_ and _Jack_ were playing outside. For fun they began digging
the ground. They found two peculiar stones, one with the shape of an _eagle_ and the other with a
_dragon._ The shape of the dragon _glowed red_ and the eagle _glowed blue._

They didn't know what to do. After all, they were merely _10 years old!_.
They _assumed_ that it was some _powerful rock,of some poweful hero,_ and started to play with it.  

They swung it from here to there, made sounds, and a lot of superhero-like
things. Now, perhaps they thought themselves as superheroes, or, I don't now
the reason, The boys kept the rocks on their body. As soon as this
happened, _The rocks melted away **into** the boys' chests!_
