# Age Of The Wild : The Beginning

_**There was a time on earth before humans, when it was Dark and Pitch-Black...**_

_The Sky..._

_The Ground..._

_The Sea..._

_Everthing was Pitch-Black and still..._

Nothing stirred.No colours was seen.

Suddenly....

A blue and black ball arouse from nowhere... 

It was sp bright that the whole place was lit for a moment. They disappeared as soon as they appeared. 
The world was again pitch black.

Years went by...

Man finally stepped on the blue planet. The surroundings had changed now. It was
broad daylight and life was seen almost everywhere. Man had now began to
conquer the world with his intelligence. He made many ways to survive.
The Man went on to become more and more advanced by the time. 

A family, like any other family, had built a house _exactly near the spot the
balls appeared_

One day _Michael_ and _Jack_ were playing outside. For fun they began digging
the ground. They found two peculiar stones, with the shape of an _eagle_ and
_dragon_.
